# WaveAuth - Flutter Animated Authentication UI

WaveAuth is a beautifully designed Flutter authentication module featuring a dynamic, animated wave background, custom gradient widgets, and a clean, modern user interface. It provides a seamless and engaging user experience for both sign-up and login flows.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Wave Animation**: A stunning, multi-layered sine wave animation creates a fluid and visually appealing background.
- **State-Managed Auth Flow**: A single `AuthScreen` manages the UI state between the initial entry screen and the login screen, preventing nested navigation stacks.
- **Custom Gradient Widgets**: Includes custom-built, reusable widgets like `GradientButton` and `GradientCircularCheckbox` that match the app's aesthetic.
- **Floating Navigation**: A floating action button provides intuitive back navigation from the login view to the entry view.
- **Centralized Theming & Constants**: Project-wide colors, strings, and text styles are centralized in the `util` directory for easy maintenance and consistency.
- **Reusable Components**: Widgets like `LoginForm` and `SocialSignInWidget` are modular and can be easily customized.
- **Responsive Validation**: The login form includes standard validation for email and password fields.

## ðŸŽ¨ Key Components

### Wave Animation

The background animation is created by stacking multiple `SineWavePainter` instances in `WaveScreen`. Each layer has a slightly different color, speed, and amplitude, creating a parallax effect. The animation is driven by an `AnimationController` that updates the UI continuously.

### Authentication Flow

The `AuthScreen` widget acts as a state machine. It holds an `AuthType` enum (`entry` or `login`) in its state. Instead of pushing new screens onto the navigation stack, UI components trigger callbacks that call `setState` on `AuthScreen`, which then rebuilds its body to show either the `AuthEntry` or `LoginScreen` widget. This creates a smooth, efficient, and predictable navigation flow.
